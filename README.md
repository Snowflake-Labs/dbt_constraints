# dbt Constraints Package

This package generates database constraints based on the tests in a dbt project. It is currently compatible with Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and Oracle only.

## Why data engineers should add referential integrity constraints

The primary reason to add constraints to your database tables is that many tools including [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) and [Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-To-Customizing-Oracle-SQL-Developer-Data-Modeler-SDDM-to-Support-Snowflake-Variant) can correctly reverse-engineer data model diagrams if there are primary keys, unique keys, and foreign keys on tables. Most BI tools will also add joins automatically between tables when you import tables that have foreign keys. This can both save time and avoid mistakes.

In addition, although Snowflake doesn't enforce most constraints, the [query optimizer can consider primary key, unique key, and foreign key constraints](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constraints-properties.html?#extended-constraint-properties) during query rewrite if the constraint is set to RELY. Since dbt can test that the data in the table complies with the constraints, this package creates constraints on Snowflake with the RELY property to improve query performance. Some database query optimizers also consider not null constraints when building an execution plan.

Many databases including [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/join-elimination.html), PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and DB2 can use referential integrity constraints to perform "[Join Elimination](https://blog.jooq.org/join-elimination-an-essential-optimiser-feature-for-advanced-sql-usage/)" to remove tables from an execution plan. This commonly occurs when you query a subset of columns from a view and some of the tables in the view are unnecessary. In addition, on databases that do not support join elimination, some [BI and visualization tools will also rewrite their queries](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/table-considerations.html#referential-integrity-constraints) based on constraint information, producing the same effect.

Finally, although most columnar databases including Snowflake do not use or need indexes, most row-oriented databases including PostgreSQL and Oracle require indexes on their primary key columns in order to perform efficient joins between tables. Typically a primary key or unique key constraint is enforced on such databases using such indexes. Having dbt create the unique indexes automatically can slightly reduce the degree of performance tuning necessary for row-oriented databases. Row-oriented databases frequently also need indexes on foreign key columns but [that is something best added manually](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/postgres-configs#indexes).

## Please note

When you add this package, dbt will automatically begin to create __unique keys__ for all your existing `unique` and `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` tests, __foreign keys__ for existing `relationship` tests, and __not null constraints__ for `not_null` tests. The package also provides three new tests (`primary_key`, `unique_key`, and `foreign_key`) that are a bit more flexible than the standard dbt tests. These tests can be used inline, out-of-line, and can support multiple columns when used in the `tests:` section of a model. The `primary_key` test will also cause a not null constraint to be created on each column.

### Disabling automatic constraint generation

The `dbt_constraints_enabled` variable can be set to `false` in your project to disable automatic constraint generation. By default dbt Constraints only creates constraints on models. To allow constraints on sources, you can set `dbt_constraints_sources_enabled` to `true`. The package will verify that you have sufficient database privileges to create constraints on sources.

```yml
vars:
  # The package can be temporarily disabled using this variable
  dbt_constraints_enabled: true

  # The package can also add constraints on sources if you have sufficient privileges
  dbt_constraints_sources_enabled: false

  # You can also be specific on which constraints are enabled for sources
  # You must also enable dbt_constraints_sources_enabled above
  dbt_constraints_sources_pk_enabled: true
  dbt_constraints_sources_uk_enabled: true
  dbt_constraints_sources_fk_enabled: true
  dbt_constraints_sources_nn_enabled: true
```

### Dependencies and Requirements

* The package's macros depend on the results and graph object schemas of dbt >=1.0.0

* The package currently only includes macros for creating constraints in Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. To add support for other databases, it is necessary to implement the following seven macros with the appropriate DDL & SQL for your database. Pull requests to contribute support for other databases are welcome. See the <ADAPTER_NAME>__create_constraints.sql files as examples.

```
<ADAPTER_NAME>__create_primary_key(table_model, column_names, verify_permissions, quote_columns=false, constraint_name=none, lookup_cache=none)
<ADAPTER_NAME>__create_unique_key(table_model, column_names, verify_permissions, quote_columns=false, constraint_name=none, lookup_cache=none)
<ADAPTER_NAME>__create_foreign_key(pk_model, pk_column_names, fk_model, fk_column_names, verify_permissions, quote_columns=false, constraint_name=none, lookup_cache=none)
<ADAPTER_NAME>__create_not_null(pk_model, pk_column_names, fk_model, fk_column_names, verify_permissions, quote_columns=false, lookup_cache=none)
<ADAPTER_NAME>__unique_constraint_exists(table_relation, column_names, lookup_cache=none)
<ADAPTER_NAME>__foreign_key_exists(table_relation, column_names, lookup_cache=none)
<ADAPTER_NAME>__have_references_priv(table_relation, verify_permissions, lookup_cache=none)
<ADAPTER_NAME>__have_ownership_priv(table_relation, verify_permissions, lookup_cache=none)
```

## dbt_constraints Limitations

Generally, if you don't meet a requirement, tests are still executed but the constraint is skipped rather than producing an error.

- All models involved in a constraint must be materialized as table, incremental, or snapshot.

-  If source constraints are enabled, the source must be a table. You must also have the `OWNERSHIP` table privilege to add a constraint. For foreign keys you also need the `REFERENCES` privilege on the parent table with the primary or unique key. The package will identify when you lack these privileges on Snowflake and PostgreSQL. Oracle does not provide an easy way to look up your effective privileges so it has an exception handler and will display Oracle's error messages.

- All columns on constraints must be individual column names, not expressions. You can reference columns on a model that come from an expression.

- Constraints are not created for failed tests

- `primary_key`, `unique_key`, and `foreign_key` tests are considered first and duplicate constraints are skipped. One exception is that you will get an error if you add two different `primary_key` tests to the same model.

- Foreign keys require that the parent table have a primary key or unique key on the referenced columns. Unique keys generated from standard `unique` tests are sufficient.

- The order of columns on a foreign key test must match between the FK columns and PK columns

- The `foreign_key` test will ignore any rows with a null column, even if only one of two columns in a compound key is null. If you also want to ensure FK columns are not null, you should add standard `not_null` tests to your model which will add not null constraints to the table.

- Referential constraints must apply to all the rows in a table so any tests with a `config: where:` property will be skipped when creating constraints.
